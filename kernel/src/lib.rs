//! # The Supervisionary kernel
//!
//! Supervisionary is a proof-checker for HOL: a polymorphic, simply-typed
//! extensional and impredicative higher-order logic.  The novelty of this
//! proof-checker lies in how it protects itself from untrusted code: unlike
//! other implementations of HOL, such as Isabelle/HOL and HOL4, where the
//! kernel is isolated using linguistic mechanisms, such as programming language
//! module boundaries and type-abstraction, Supervisionary uses machine-oriented
//! notions of isolation more typically-found in operating systems, namely
//! privilege levels and different memory spaces.
//!
//! Note: this library defines the Supervisionary kernel and is therefore
//! trusted code.  Also, this module is more-or-less fully independent of the
//! individual Wasm execution engines that we may choose to use (e.g., there is
//! little to no WASMI and Wasmtime-specific code in this module, barring one
//! ugly dependency on WASMI in `error_code` due to issues with Rust's traits).
//! All execution engine-specific code is in wrapper modules that make use of
//! this module as a library (see e.g., `wasmi-bindings` for bindings to the
//! WASMI execution engine).
