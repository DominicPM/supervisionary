//! # HOL terms
//!
//! HOL's terms are the terms of the explicitly-typed λ-calculus, extended with
//! constants.  The grammar is recursively-defined, as follows:
//!
//! ```
//!     r,s,t ::= x:τ | C:τ | rs | λx:τ. r
//! ```
//!
//! Here, to each type `τ` we associate a countably-infinite set of *variables*.
//! We use `x:τ`, `y:τ`, and so on, to range arbitratily over the variables
//! associated with type `τ`.
//!
//! We use `C` to range arbitrarily over constants.  Note that constants have a
//! *declared* type, which is registered with the kernel when they are first
//! created.  We allow constants to be used with a type that is more constrained
//! than the declared type.  This will allow us to declare e.g. a polymorphic
//! list cons function, with type `⍺ ⭢ List ⍺ ⭢ List ⍺` but then later use that
//! constant at the monomorphic type `Nat ⭢ List Nat ⭢ List Nat`, for example.
//! As a result, constants are explicitly decorated with a type `C:τ` which
//! should always be a type-refinement of the declared type of the constant.
//!
//! Applications and λ-abstractions follow their usual interpretation.
//!
//! Note that we assume a range of built-in constants.  These include the full
//! gamut of logical connectives and quantifiers with their most-general (read:
//! polymorphic) types.  These will be used to construct theorems, later.
//!
//! Lastly, note that terms are constructed recursively, via a process which
//! builds bigger terms out of existing ones.  We need to break this recursion
//! in Supervisionary.  We do this by making any recursive reference to another
//! term an indirection through the kernel's heaps, instead, through the use of
//! a kernel handle.  This pattern can be seen in e.g. the `Application`
//! constructor, which contains two handles pointing-to other objects in the
//! heaps.  It is a basic kernel invariant that these sorts of internal pointers
//! never "dangle", and always remain pointing-to some valid object of an
//! appropriate type.
//!
//! As a consequence of this design pattern, the majority of term-related
//! functionality (especially functionality, like substitution and free-variable
//! calculation, which is recursive) is not implemented in this module, but is
//! moved "up" into the runtime state, where reference to the kernel's heaps
//! can be made.  This module therefore contains basic functionality for
//! building and decomposing terms.
